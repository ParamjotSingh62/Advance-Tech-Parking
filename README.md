# Advance-Tech-Parking
A user friendly web interface, users can sign up, login and create their profiles for booking their slots for parking. In booking slot, they need to input the date and check for the number of slots corresponding to their required time. once the user books the slot, he/she need to take the screenshot of slip, for further payment process and for authentication during actual parking and check out. User can check their all parking slot under notifications section on dashboard. User feedback form is also there on dastboard. Payment thing is yet in making.. :)
